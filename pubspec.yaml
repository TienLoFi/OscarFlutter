# The following section is specific to Flutter.
flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true
  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/icon/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Icons
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/icons.ttf

    - family: SF Pro Display
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display-Regular.otf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/SF-Pro-Display-Bold.otf
          weight: 700

    - family: Amaranth
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Amaranth-Regular.ttf
          weight: 500
        - asset: fonts/Amaranth-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700

    - family: AvenirNext
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/AvenirNextLTPro-Bold.otf
          weight: 700
